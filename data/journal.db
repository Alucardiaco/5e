Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.</p><p>This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your character might pursue between adventures.</p><p>Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book's introduction:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">1. The DM describes the environment.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">2. The players describe what they want to do.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">3. The DM narrates the results of their actions.</li></ul><p>Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions.</p><p>The DM's notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers' actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a time line or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"733\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Time</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p181</span></span> <p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</p><p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.</p><p>For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.</p><p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"734\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Movement</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p181</span></span> <p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope all sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.</p><p>The DM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM can summarize movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\"Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"735\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Speed</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p181</span></span> <p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.</p><p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"736\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Travel Pace</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p181</span></span> <p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the \"Activity While Traveling\" section later in this chapter for more information).</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"737\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Forced March.</span></span> <p>The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'exhaustion_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >exhaustion</a>.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'exhaustion_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >exhaustion</a> (see the appendix).</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"738\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mounts and Vehicles.</span></span> <p>For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter 5), and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p><p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master's Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.</p></div><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Travel Pace</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Pace</th><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Distance Traveled per Minute</th><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Distance Traveled per Hour</th><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Distance Traveled per Day</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2\"  >Fast</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >400 feet</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >4 miles</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >30 miles</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (<span class=\"help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 106, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Perception</span>) scores</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2\"  >Normal</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >300 feet</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >3 miles</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >24 miles</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >-</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2\"  >Slow</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >200 feet</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >2 miles</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >18 miles</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >Able to use stealth</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"739\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Difficult Terrain</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p182</span></span> <p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors.

The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing something, such a moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything happens.</p><p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p><p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves.</p><p>When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p><p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"769\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Social Interaction</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p185</span></span> <p>Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.</p><p>Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don't belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).</p><p>In general terms, an NPC's attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.</p><p>Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"770\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p185</span></span> <p>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.</p><p>Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character's quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.</p><p>There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"771\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p185</span></span> <p>With this approach, you describe your character's words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.</p><p>For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family's misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek's table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.</p><p>Chris says, \"Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.\" In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek's mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character's attitude and actions.</p><p>When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Describe your character's emotions and attitude.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Focus on your character's intent and how others might perceive it.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Don't worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.</li></ul></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"772\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Active Approach to Roleplaying</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p186</span></span> <p>If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.</p><p>When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character's voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character's movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can't be reasonably acted out.</p><p>Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here's how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:</p><p>Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, \"I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I'd snap your arm and enjoy your screams.\" In his normal voice, Chris then adds, \"I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.\"</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"773\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Results of Roleplaying</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p186</span></span> <p>The DM uses your character's actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.</p><p>When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM's portrayal of the NPC's mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC's personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC's attitude.</p><p>Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"774\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ability Checks</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p186</span></span> <p>In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.</p><p>Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC's reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM's discretion.</p><p>Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills.

For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"777\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Long Rest</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p186</span></span> <p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p><p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them. You regain at least 1 Hit Die when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p><p>A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"778\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Between Adventures</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p186</span></span> <p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.</p><p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"779\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lifestyle Expenses</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p187</span></span> <p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.</p><p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"780\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Downtime Activities</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p187</span></span> <p>Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p><p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your DM.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"781\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Crafting</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p187</span></span> <p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#smith's%20tools_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'items.html', 'phb', 'smith\\'s%20tools_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >smith's tools</a> needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p><p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p><p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p><p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"782\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Practicing a Profession</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p187</span></span> <p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).

When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like beacons against the darkness, it's hard to be ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence.</p><p>Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different gods at different times and circumstances. People in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. And a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest or champion of that god's ideals. Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, you can choose a single deity for your character to serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that your character prays to most often. Or just make a mental note of the gods who are revered in your DM's campaign so you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you're playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves or served, and consider the deity's suggested domains when selecting your character's domain.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"904\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Life and Death Domains</span></span><p>Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain, particularly if they are closely associated with healing, protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.</p><p>A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, but if you want to worship a god of death, consult your Dungeon Master.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"905\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">D&D Pantheons</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p293</span></span> <p>Each world in the D&D multiverse has its own pantheons of deities, ranging in size from the teeming pantheons of the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk to the more focused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance.

important revolves around a pantheon called the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark Six. The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have dominion over every aspect of existence, and to speak with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primitive, bloody, and cruel gods who offer a dissenting voice. Eberron's other religions are very different from the traditional D&D pantheons. The monotheistic Church of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead who have secured that immortality. Various mad cults are devoted to the demons and horrors imprisoned in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that the world is heading toward a glorious future where the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed into light. And two related nations of elves revere their ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"910\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Deities of Eberron.</span></span> <table class=\"

The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.</p><p>The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym). Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different families sometimes have overlap in their spheres of influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir) are both associated with the sun, for example.</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Norse Deities</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-3\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Deity</th><th class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Alignment</th><th class=\"col-3\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Suggested Domains</th><th class=\"col-5\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Symbol</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Odin, god of knowledge and war</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >NG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Knowledge, War</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Watching blue eye</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Aegir, god of the sea and storms</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >NE</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Tempest</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Rough ocean waves</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Balder, god of beauty and poetry</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >NG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Life, Light</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Gem-encrusted silver chalice</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Forseti, god of justice and law</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >N</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Light</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Head of a bearded man</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Frey, god of fertility and the sun</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >NG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Life, Light</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Ice-blue greatsword</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Freya, goddess of fertility and love</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >NG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Life</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Falcon</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Frigga, goddess of birth and fertility</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >N</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Life, Light</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Cat</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Heimdall, god of watchfulness and loyalty</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >LG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Light, War</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Curling musical horn</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Hel, goddess of the underworld</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >NE</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Death</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Woman's face, rotting on one side</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Hermod, god of luck</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >CN</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Trickery</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Winged scroll</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Loki, god of thieves and trickery</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >CE</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Trickery</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Flame</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Njord, god of sea and wind</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >NG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Nature, Tempest</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Gold coin</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Odur, god of light and the sun</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >CG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Light</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Solar disk</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Sif, goddess of war</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >CG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >War</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Upraised sword</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Skadi, god of earth and mountains</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >N</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Nature</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Mountain peak</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Surtur, god of fire giants and war</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >LE</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >War</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Flaming sword</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Thor, god of storms and thunder</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >CG</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Tempest, War</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Hammer</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Thrym, god of fire giants and cold</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >CE</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >War</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >White double-bladed axe</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Tyr, god of courage and strategy</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >LN</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Knowledge, War</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Sword</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-3\"  >Uller, god of hunting and winter</td><td class=\"col-1 text-center\"  >CN</td><td class=\"col-3\"  >Nature</td><td class=\"col-5\"  >Longbow</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div>"}

Your character is a combination of various statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons & Dragons world.</p><p>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brave rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like barbarian or paladin. If you don't know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see what catches your interest.</p><p>Once you have a character in mind, roll on these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that you come to the table with a character you're excited to play.</p><p>Throughout this chapter, we use the term <b>character sheet</b> to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it's a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of this book), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"449\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Building Bruenor</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p11</span></span> <p>Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf character, Bruenor.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"450\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">1. Choose a Race</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p11</span></span> <p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have <b>subraces</b>, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races.</p><p>The race you choose contributes to your character's identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character's race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.</p><p>Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.</p><p>Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"451\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">2. Choose a Class</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p11</span></span> <p>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.</p><p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are <b>class features</b>-capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of <b>proficiencies:</b> armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p><p>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"452\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Level</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p11</span></span> <p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining <b>experience points</b> (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.</p><p>Starting off at 1st level marks your character's entry into the adventuring life. If you're already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.</p><p>Record your level on your character sheet. If you're starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see \"Beyond 1st Level\" later in this chapter).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"453\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span><p>Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"454\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hit Points and Hit Dice</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p12</span></span> <p>Your character's hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p><p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you'll determine in step 3.) This is also your <b>hit point maximum</b>.</p><p>Record your character's hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see \"Resting\" in chapter 8).</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"455\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Proficiency Bonus</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p12</span></span> <p>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you'll be recording on your character sheet:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Attack rolls using weapons you're proficient with</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Attack rolls with spells you cast</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Ability checks using skills you're proficient in</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Ability checks using tools you're proficient with</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Saving throws you're proficient in</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</li></ul><p>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.</p><p>Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"456\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Building Bruenor, Step 2</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p12</span></span> <p>Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a fighter and notes the fighter's proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.</p><p>As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10 and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor's Constitution score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"457\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">3. Determine Ability Scores</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p12</span></span> <p>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: <b>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</b> Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p><p>The six abilities and their use in the game are described in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.</p><p>You generate your character's six <b>ability scores</b> randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don't like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p><p>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character's six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.</p><p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your <b>ability modifiers</b> using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Ability Score Summary</caption><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><b>Strength</b></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Measures:</i> Natural athleticism, bodily power</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p><i>Important for:</i> Barbarian, fighter, paladin</p><p><a href=\"https://5e.tools/races.html#blankhash,flstability%20bonus%20(including%20subrace):strength%20%2b2=1~strength%20%2b1=1\"   >Races that have a bonus to Strength</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Ability Score Summary</caption><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><b>Dexterity</b></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Measures:</i> Physical agility, reflexes, balance, poise</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p><i>Important for:</i> Monk, ranger, rogue</p><p><a href=\"https://5e.tools/races.html#blankhash,flstability%20bonus%20(including%20subrace):dexterity%20%2b2=1~dexterity%20%2b1=1\"   >Races that have a bonus to Dexterity</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Ability Score Summary</caption><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><b>Constitution</b></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Measures:</i> Health, stamina, vital force</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p><i>Important for:</i> Everyone</p><p><a href=\"https://5e.tools/races.html#blankhash,flstability%20bonus%20(including%20subrace):constitution%20%2b2=1~constitution%20%2b1=1\"   >Races that have a bonus to Constitution</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Ability Score Summary</caption><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><b>Intelligence</b></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Measures:</i> Mental acuity, information recall, analytical skill</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p><i>Important for:</i> Wizard</p><p><a href=\"https://5e.tools/races.html#blankhash,flstability%20bonus%20(including%20subrace):intelligence%20%2b2=1~intelligence%20%2b1=1\"   >Races that have a bonus to Intelligence</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Ability Score Summary</caption><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><b>Wisdom</b></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Measures:</i> Awareness, intuition, insight</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p><i>Important for:</i> Cleric, druid</p><p><a href=\"https://5e.tools/races.html#blankhash,flstability%20bonus%20(including%20subrace):wisdom%20%2b2=1~wisdom%20%2b1=1\"   >Races that have a bonus to Wisdom</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Ability Score Summary</caption><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><b>Charisma</b></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-12\"  ><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Measures:</i> Confidence, eloquence, leadership</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p><i>Important for:</i> Bard, sorcerer, warlock</p><p><a href=\"https://5e.tools/races.html#blankhash,flstability%20bonus%20(including%20subrace):charisma%20%2b2=1~charisma%20%2b1=1\"   >Races that have a bonus to Charisma</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"458\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Building Bruenor, Step 3</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p13</span></span> <p>Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor's abilities. Since he's a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor's Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor's ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1).</p><p>Bob fills in Bruenor's final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"459\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: Customizing Ability Scores</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p13</span></span> <p>At your Dungeon Master's option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores.

Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases.

A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.</p><p>A character with high <b>Intelligence</b> might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.</p><p>A character with high <b>Wisdom</b> has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what's going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.</p><p>A character with high <b>Charisma</b> exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence.

His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.</p><p>Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but his clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.</p><p>Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor's personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law.</p><p>Given his history, Bruenor's bond is obvious: he aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.</p><p>His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"463\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">5.

All such items are detailed in chapter 5.</p><p>Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of <b>gold pieces</b> (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in chapter 5. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter.</p><p>If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the Trinkets table at the end of chapter 5).</p><p>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry.

Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.</p><p>Without armor or a shield, your character's AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC on your character sheet.</p><p>Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class.</p><p>There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in chapter 5.</p><p>Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC.

His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.</p><p>For Bruenor's weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5.</p><p>The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage.

Come Together</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p15</span></span> <p>Most D&D characters don't work alone. Each character plays a role within a <b>party,</b> a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party's chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"468\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond 1st Level</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p15</span></span> <p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called <b>gaining a level</b>.</p><p>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can't increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.</p><p>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).</p><p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.</p><p>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"469\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tiers of Play</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p15</span></span> <p>The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don't have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.</p><p><b>In the first tier (levels 1-4),</b> characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard's Arcane Tradition or a fighter's Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages.</p><p><b>In the second tier (levels 5-10),</b> characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#fireball_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'fireball_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >fireball</a> and <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#lightning%20bolt_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'lightning%20bolt_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >lightning bolt</a>. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p><p><b>In the third tier (levels 11-16),</b> characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole regions and continents.</p><p><b>At the fourth tier (levels 17-20),</b> characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.</p></div><table class=\" striped-odd\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Experience Points</th><th class=\"col-4 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Level</th><th class=\"col-4 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Proficiency Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >0</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >1</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >300</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >2</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >900</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >3</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >2,700</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >4</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >6,500</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >5</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >14,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >6</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >23,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >7</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >34,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >8</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >48,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >9</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >64,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >10</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >85,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >11</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >100,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >12</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >120,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >13</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >140,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >14</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >165,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >15</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >195,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >16</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >225,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >17</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+6</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >265,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >18</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+6</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >305,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >19</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+6</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >355,000</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >20</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\"  >+6</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>"}

Combat in D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.</p><p>This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master.</p><p>The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. \"You\" can also mean the character or monster that you control.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"787\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Combat Step by Step</span></span><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p><span class=\"bold list-item-title\">1.

The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"789\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Surprise</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p189</span></span> <p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.</p><p>The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (<span class=\"help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 124, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Stealth</span>) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (<span class=\"help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 125, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Perception</span>) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</p><p>If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"790\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Initiative</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p189</span></span> <p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.</p><p>The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p><p>If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"791\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Your Turn</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p189</span></span> <p>On your turn, you can <b>move</b> a distance up to your speed and <b>take one action</b>. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.</p><p>The most common actions you can take are described in the \"Actions in Combat\" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p><p>The \"Movement and Position\" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.</p><p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn.

The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.</p><p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p><p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"793\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Other Activity on Your Turn</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p190</span></span> <p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p><p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p><p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p><p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p><p>The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"794\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Interacting with Objects Around You</span></span><p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">draw or sheathe a sword</li><li class=\"rd__li \">open or close a door</li><li class=\"rd__li \">withdraw a potion from your backpack</li><li class=\"rd__li \">pick up a dropped axe</li><li class=\"rd__li \">take a bauble from a table</li><li class=\"rd__li \">remove a ring from your finger</li><li class=\"rd__li \">stuff some food into your mouth</li><li class=\"rd__li \">plant a banner in the ground</li><li class=\"rd__li \">fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li><li class=\"rd__li \">drink all the ale in a flagon</li><li class=\"rd__li \">throw a lever or a switch</li><li class=\"rd__li \">pull a torch from a sconce</li><li class=\"rd__li \">take a book from a shelf you can reach</li><li class=\"rd__li \">extinguish a small flame</li><li class=\"rd__li \">don a mask</li><li class=\"rd__li \">pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li><li class=\"rd__li \">put your ear to a door</li><li class=\"rd__li \">kick a small stone</li><li class=\"rd__li \">turn a key in a lock</li><li class=\"rd__li \">tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li><li class=\"rd__li \">hand an item to another character</li></ul><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"795\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reactions</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p190</span></span> <p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.</p><p>When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"796\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Movement and Position</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p190</span></span> <p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p><p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p><p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p><p>The \"Special Types of Movement\" section in chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"797\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Breaking Up Your Move</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p190</span></span> <p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"798\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Moving between Attacks</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p190</span></span> <p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"799\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Different Speeds</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p190</span></span> <p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.</p><p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"800\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Difficult Terrain</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p190</span></span> <p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.</p><p>Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p><p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p><p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"801\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Being Prone</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p190</span></span> <p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'prone_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >prone</a>, a condition described in the appendix.</p><p>You can drop <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'prone_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >prone</a> without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p>To move while <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'prone_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >prone</a>, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"802\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Moving around Other Creatures</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p191</span></span> <p>You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.</p><p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.</p><p>If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"803\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Flying Movement</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p191</span></span> <p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling.

A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p><p>A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p><p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature.</p><p>If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"806\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Squeezing into a Smaller Space</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p192</span></span> <p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"807\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: Playing on a Grid</span></span><p>If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"808\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Squares.</span></span> <p>Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"809\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Speed.</span></span> <p>Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid.

You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.</p><p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature.

When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury.

A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p><p>A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"854\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p197</span></span> <p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'unconscious_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >unconscious</a>, as explained in the following sections.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"855\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Instant Death</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p197</span></span> <p>Massive damage can kill you instantly.

Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p><p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p><p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p><p>Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p><p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.</p><p>They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p><p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"864\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mounted Combat</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p198</span></span> <p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.</p><p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"865\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mounting and Dismounting</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p198</span></span> <p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount.

A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor's adventurous footsteps.</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Starting Wealth by Class</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Class</th><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Funds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Barbarian</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 2d4×10]] (2d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Bard</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 5d4×10]] (5d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Cleric</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 5d4×10]] (5d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Druid</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 2d4×10]] (2d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Fighter</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 5d4×10]] (5d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Monk</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 5d4]] gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Paladin</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 5d4×10]] (5d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Ranger</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 5d4×10]] (5d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Rogue</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 4d4×10]] (4d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Sorcerer</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 3d4×10]] (3d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Warlock</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 4d4×10]] (4d4 × 10) gp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Wizard</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >[[/r 4d4×10]] (4d4 × 10) gp</td></tr></tbody></table></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"517\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wealth</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p143</span></span> <p>Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world. Coins, gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese. Members of the nobility trade in legal rights, such as the rights to mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire deal in coins.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"518\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Coinage</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p143</span></span> <p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p><p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a quiver, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p><p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a set of dice, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.</p><p>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</p><p>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</p><p>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Standard Exchange Rates</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Coin</th><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >cp</th><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >sp</th><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >ep</th><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >gp</th><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >pp</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2\"  >Copper (cp)</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/10</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/50</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/100</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/1,000</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2\"  >Silver (sp)</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >10</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/5</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/10</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/100</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2\"  >Electrum (ep)</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >50</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >5</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/2</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/20</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2\"  >Gold (gp)</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >100</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >10</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >2</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1/10</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2\"  >Platinum (pp)</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1,000</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >100</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >20</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >10</td><td class=\"col-2\"  >1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"519\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Selling Treasure</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p144</span></span> <p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore.

class=\"rd__title-link\">p146</span></span> <p>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p><p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"551\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Weapon Properties</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p146</span></span> <p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"552\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ammunition.</span></span> <p>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\" late in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"553\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Finesse.</span></span> <p>When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"558\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reach.</span></span> <p>This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it.

If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"561\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Two-Handed.</span></span> <p>This weapon requires two hands to use.

For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p><p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"564\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Silvered Weapons</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p148</span></span> <p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp.

Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"621\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artisan's Tools.</span></span> <p>These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade.

The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.</p><p>An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.</p><p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"631\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Barding</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p155</span></span> <p>Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body.

Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease.

of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.</p><p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle.

Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p><p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#leomund's%20secret%20chest_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'leomund\\'s%20secret%20chest_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >Leomund's secret chest</a> spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.</p><p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p><p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Services</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Service</th><th class=\"col-6\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Pay</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  ><i>Coach cab</i></td><td class=\"col-6\"  ></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  ><div class=\"rd__tab-indent\"></div>Between towns</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >3 cp per mile</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  ><div class=\"rd__tab-indent\"></div>Coach cab, Within a city</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >1 cp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  ><i>Hireling</i></td><td class=\"col-6\"  ></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  ><div class=\"rd__tab-indent\"></div>Skilled</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >2 gp per day</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  ><div class=\"rd__tab-indent\"></div>Untrained</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >2 sp per day</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Messenger</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >2 cp per mile</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Road or gate toll</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >1 cp</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6\"  >Ship's passage</td><td class=\"col-6\"  >1 sp per mile</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"648\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting Services</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p159</span></span> <p>People who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p><p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:1=1\"   >1st</a> or <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:2=1\"   >2nd</a> level, such as <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'cure%20wounds_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >cure wounds</a> or <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#identify_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'identify_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >identify</a>, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"649\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trinkets</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p159</span></span> <p>When you make your character, you can roll once on the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#trinket_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'items.html', 'phb', 'trinket_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >Trinkets</a> table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly touched by mystery.

This change makes combat more routine, since characters can easily recover from every battle. You might want to make combat encounters more difficult to compensate.</p><p>Spellcasters using this system can afford to burn through spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels. Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots (rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit spell slots restored to 5th level or lower.

Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact. However, the same orc horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.</p>\n<p>In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.</p>\n<p>When the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read:</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins-crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars-surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.</p>\n<p>As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>If Sildar Hallwinter is with the party, add:</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>Sildar seems much more at ease.</p>\n<p>\"My friends,\" he says, \"let us secure lodgings. I'm told the local inn is very quaint.\"</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>Sildar's plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the \"Townmaster's Hall\" section).</p>\n<p>During this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the \"Town Description\" section for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the characters arrive late in the day and can't get to more than one or two locations before it's time to seek lodgings for the night.</p>\n<p>Some locales the characters should visit include the following:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \"><strong>Barthen's Provisions.</strong> If the characters have the wagonload of supplies from the \"Meet Me in Phandalin\" adventure hook, they are meant to deliver it to this shop.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \"><strong>Lionshield Coster.</strong> If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \"><strong>Stonehill Inn.</strong> If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill appears to be the best available option.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"150\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Encounters in Phandalin</span></span>\n<p>When the characters explore Phandalin, you don't need to keep track of how much time is spent at each location. Instead, imagine that you're directing an old-style western movie. Your goal is to present several scenes in which the adventurers walk into a store or saloon and meet the people there. By interacting with these NPCs, the adventurers learn what the NPCs need or what information they want to share, then can move on to the next location. These scenes are a series of roleplaying encounters that take place over the course of a couple of days of game time.</p>\n<p>To begin, ask the players where they want to go and what they want to do in town. For example, you could tell them, \"There's an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores and trading posts, and a few other homes and businesses. Where do you want to go?\" When the players pick a spot, refer to the description in the following section, introduce the NPCs there, and let the interaction begin.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"151\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Stonehill Inn</span></span>\n<p>If the players aren't sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs there are \"pointers\" who can direct the characters toward the various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town. By visiting the inn, the characters learn what other places they should visit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"152\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Redbrand Ruffians</span></span>\n<p>Sooner or later, the adventurers run into the thugs who run Phandalin. All you need to do is choose when the ruffians appear. After the characters have had a chance to visit several locations in town and talk to the townsfolk, they might decide to go looking for the Redbrands. When they do, run the \"Redbrand Ruffians\" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"153\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Finding Cragmaw Castle</span></span>\n<p>The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. Qelline Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"154\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Important NPCs</span></span>\n<p>Here is a quick summary of the most important NPCs in Phandalin, and their relevance to the adventure.</p>\n<table class=\" \">\n<thead></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Toblen Stonehill</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Innkeeper.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Elmar Barthen</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Owns a trading post - owes money to the party if you are using the \"Meet Me in Phandalin\" adventure hook.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Daran Edermath</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Member of the Order of the Gauntlet with a quest for the party.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Linene Graywind</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Runs a trading post and offers a reward for retrieving her supplies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Halia Thornton</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Member of the Zhentarim with a quest for the party.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Qelline Alderleaf</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Helpful halfling farmer whose son, Carp, knows a secret way into the Redbrands' hideout.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Sister Garaele</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Elf cleric of Tymora and Harper agent with a quest for the party.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Harbin Wester</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Townmaster of Phandalin with a quest for the party.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 bold\">Sildar Hallwinter</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Sildar Hallwinter is a retired soldier and sellsword who hails from the city of Neverwinter.

You don't need to be an actor or stand-up comedian to get good drama or humor out of your NPCs, but if you want to ham it up, here's some advice:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \"><strong>Relax.</strong> Don't worry about impressing your players with your thespian skills (or lack thereof).</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \"><strong>Get inside the NPCs' minds.</strong> Imagine how they might react to the characters, and strive to be realistic.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \"><strong>Mug it up.</strong> Scowl, smile, snarl, flutter your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, rub your hands together-what-ever it takes to make your NPCs come to life.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \"><strong>Try different voices.</strong> Borrow distinctive speech patterns from real life, movies, and television. Adjust the volume as appropriate. An NPC can be loud, soft-spoken, or something in between.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \"><strong>Keep the game moving.</strong> Let the players steer the interactions with the NPCs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The characters have no reason to fight ordinary townsfolk.

If the characters decide to stay here, see \"Food, Drink, and Lodging\" in the rulebook for pricing. (The characters' other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Doran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)</p>\n<p>The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"158\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rumors</span></span>\n<p>Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with a number of good leads to explore in and around town.

Barthen's does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see \"Adventuring Gear\" in the rulebook.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster (see that section).</p>\n<p>The proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner.

If the characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker's capture, Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills.

A fit, silver-haired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.</p>\n<p>Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.</p>\n<p>Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it's time someone took a stand against the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff. Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town.

He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who's there and what they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there.

In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. There isn't any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.</p>\n<p>The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton. In her attempts to establish the Miner's Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don't cross her.</p>\n<p>Halia doesn't know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"174\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quest: Halia's Job Offer</span></span>\n<p>If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem.

That night, the gang returned and abducted the family from their home in Phandalin. The gang plans to sell the family into slavery.</p>\n<p>The Dendrars are grateful to the characters for rescuing them, but they can't provide much information about the Redbrand hideout.

Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails.</p>\n<p>The cavern continues for some distance to the south.

Crevasse</span></span>\n<p>The characters arrive here by one of three routes: the tunnel from area 1, the storeroom at area 7, or the roughhewn passage to the south, which continues off the map for about one hundred feet and emerges from a tunnel in the woods south of Tresendar Manor. The passage is an excellent way to smuggle people or goods in and out of Phandalin without being seen, and is thus perfect for a gang of slavers and thieves.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>A cold breeze fills this large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh. A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling. Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>The guardian of this cave is a @Actor[sBPxFoRemYtGTudA]{nothic}, an insane subterranean monster that hungers for flesh. The creature, lured by a faint magical effect emanating from the crevasse, was occupying the area when the Redbrands moved in. Iarno managed to strike a bargain with the monster, convincing it to help guard the stronghold in exchange for treasure and the occasional gift of fresh meat. Still, the nothic is untrustworthy.</p>\n<p>The nothic lurks near the west ends of the two bridges. If it notices intruders entering the cave, it hides behind one of the large stone columns and watches them, attempting to use its Weird Insight (see the creature's stat block) to discern the characters' secrets.</p>\n<p>The nothic communicates using telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and isn't above betraying the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. When roleplaying the nothic, consider speaking in whispers and throwing in some mad cackles and bits of gibberish. Also be sure to mention that the creature isn't actually talking but rather filling the characters' heads with its foul murmurings and demands for food. The nothic knows everything the Redbrands know; see the \"What the Redbrands Know\" sidebar on page 20.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"224\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bridges</span></span>\n<p>These bridges are made of wooden planks and have no rails. The south one is rigged to collapse when a creature weighing more than 50 pounds moves across it.

Its rough walls are easily climbed without an ability check. A creature that falls into the crevasse takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone in a jumble of rubble that is difficult terrain (see \"Difficult Terrain\" in the rulebook).</p>\n</div>\n<p>The bottom of the crevasse feels unnaturally cold. When viewed with a @Item[j2giPkXb33hGJJZE]{detect magic} spell, the area emanates a faint necromantic aura. The magic causes all organic matter in the crevasse to age and decompose at half the normal rate.</p>\n<p>Currently heaped at the bottom among broken and well-gnawed bones is the half-eaten body of Thel Dendrar, the woodcarver of Phandalin who was murdered by the Redbrands.

The chest can't be seen from the edge of the crevasse, but is obvious to any character who descends into the fissure. The chest contains 160 sp, 120 gp, five malachite gems (15 gp each), two potions of healing, and a scroll of augury.</p>\n<p>The chest also holds a +1 longsword in a silver-chased scabbard. The sword is inscribed with the name \"Talon,\" and its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. It once belonged to a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the sword and recalls this lore.</p>\n<p>Sir Aldith died fighting off the orcs that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor.

The goblin, Droop, falls unconscious at the sight of the party, but another creature can use an action to wake him. Otherwise, Droop remains unconscious for 1d10 minutes.</p>\n<p>The bugbears work for the Black Spider and were sent here to help Iarno keep the Redbrands and the citizens of Phandalin in line. The leader is named Mosk. He wears a jeweled eye patch even though he has both his eyes. Mask wears the eye patch because he thinks it's fancy.</p>\n<p>The bugbears avoid the human members of the Redbrands. If the characters are wearing scarlet cloaks taken from elsewhere, the bugbears assume that they serve Iarno. Clever characters might even persuade the bugbears to help deal with \"traitors\" or \"impostors\" elsewhere in the dungeon. If you don't think the players are doing a great job roleplaying the deception, you can have the character who is doing most of the talking make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to convince the bugbears to do what the party wants.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"229\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Role Playing Droop</span></span>\n<p>The goblin, Droop, is not a threat to the party.

He is such a coward that if he is ordered to fight, he does so with disadvantage (as explained in the rulebook).</p>\n<p>Droop knows the general layout of the Redbrand hideout, as well as the location of its secret doors and traps. He doesn't think to offer up the information, but if prompted, he reveals as much as he can remember in an attempt to be useful to the party. Some of the details might be confusing or mixed up. He is a goblin, after all.</p>\n<p>If the bugbears are dispatched, Droop tries to ingratiate himself with the party. He doesn't remember the route to Cragmaw Castle, but he knows it's up north, in the forest. He also knows that Cragmaw goblins patrol around Phandalin, and he suggests the characters might be able to capture a patrol to learn more about the castle.</p>\n<p>Characters might be inclined to keep Droop around for a while.

This makes for a mysterious rattling sound, followed by shouts and groans and a sudden gabble of voices as wagers are paid. If the characters burst into the room, they automatically surprise its occupants.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>Several worn tables and chairs are scattered around this large room.

All four have been drinking heavily, and they are poisoned (see the appendix in the rulebook for the effects of being poisoned).</p>\n<p>The Redbrands immediately recognize characters wearing scarlet cloaks as impostors. However, fast-talking characters might still be able to pass themselves off as \"new recruits,\" especially if they offer to join the game.

The rat moves at a speed of 20 feet and has AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. If the rat is killed, it disappears.</p>\n<p>If the characters leave the rat unharmed, it follows them around as though curious or hungry.

In addition, Urmon records that a magic mace named @Item[nqUFUalFMFOuyiT1]{lightbringer} was commissioned by priests of Lathander, the god of dawn, from the mages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver's Pact.

The journey takes them south along the High Road to the Triboar Trail, which heads east (as shown on the overland map). When they're a half-day's march from Phandalin, they run into trouble with goblin raiders from the Cragmaw tribe.</p><p>Read the boxed text when you're ready to start. If you create a different adventure hook, skip to the second paragraph and adjust the details as necessary, ignoring the information about driving the wagon.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found \"something big,\" and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to \"take care of business.\"</p><p>You've spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail.</p><p>You've encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Before continuing with the adventure, take a few minutes to do the following:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven't done so already.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Ask the players to think about how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player's character get out of a tough scrape. This exercise is a great opportunity for the players to contribute to the adventure's backstory.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Ask the players to give you the party's marching order and how their characters are traveling. Who's in front, and who's bringing up the rear? If the characters are escorting Gundren's wagonload of supplies, then one or two characters need to be driving the wagon. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead, as they like.</li></ul><p><b>Driving the Wagon</b></p><p>Any character can drive a wagon, and no particular skill is necessary. Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding the reins, the oxen stop where they are.</p><p>The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.</p><p>When you're ready, continue with the \"Goblin Ambush\" section.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"112\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goblin Ambush</span></span> <p>Read the following boxed text to start the encounter:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If you are using the \"Meet Me in Phandalin\" adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They've been dead about a day, and it's clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Four @Actor[bfXqf0SarsbxXOpt]{goblins} are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.</p><p>This will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Review the goblin stat block in appendix B. Since the goblins are hiding, you'll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party cannot surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins, rolling once for all of them. Roll a d20, add the goblins' Stealth skill modifier (+6) to the roll, and compare the result to the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins' check result is surprised and loses his or her turn during the first round of combat (see \"Surprise\" in the rulebook).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Use the initiative rules in the rulebook to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone's initiative count in the margins of this book or on a separate piece of paper.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins' stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. For more information on what the goblins can do on their turn, see chapter 2, \"Combat,\" in the rulebook.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail.</li></ul><p><b>Developments</b></p><p>In the unlikely event that the goblins defeat the adventurers, they leave them unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the Cragmaw hideout. The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen's Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins' trail.</p><p>The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows (see the \"What the Goblins Know\" sidebar on page 8). A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way (see the \"Goblin Trail\" section).</p><p>The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip ahead to part 2, \"Phandalin.\" Elmar Barthen (the owner of Barthen's Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived. He recounts the goblin troubles and suggests that the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster (see page 16) can provide more information on the goblin attacks.</p><p><b>Rests</b></p><p>The party might need to rest after the goblin ambush, depending on how the battle plays out. See the rulebook for more information on short rests and long rests.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"113\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goblin Trail</span></span> <p>After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.</p><p>The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.</p><p>The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party's marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.</p><p><b>Snare.</b> About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare's cord. (See the appendix in the rulebook for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn't carefully lowered down takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.</p><p><b>Pit.</b> Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn't detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The pit's walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.</p><p><b>Awarding Experience Points</b></p><p>Defeating the goblin ambushers and finding the Cragmaw hideout completes a story milestone. When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character 75 XP. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"114\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cragmaw Hideout</span></span> <p>The Cragmaw tribe of goblins has established a hideout from which it can easily harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. The Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.</p><p>The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.</p><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Cragmaw Hideout.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Cragmaw Hideout\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Cragmaw Hideout.jpg\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Cragmaw Hideout</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Cragmaw Hideout (Player).jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Cragmaw Hideout (Player)\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Cragmaw Hideout (Player).jpg\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Cragmaw Hideout (Player)</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p><p><b>Adventure Maps</b></p><p>Maps that appear in this adventure are for the DM's eyes only.</p><p>A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren't meant to see-hence the need for secrecy.</p><p>Maps are best used to show multiroom lairs and other locations that have many places to explore. Therefore, not every location needs a map.</p><p>When the players arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a separate piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"115\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Scale and Grid</span></span> <p>A scale allows you to measure distances and dimensions accurately, which is important for combat encounters, magical effects, and light sources, among other things.

It's about twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The dwarf and his map were delivered to King Grol, as instructed.

A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets.

(Goblins can be lazy that way.) However, if the characters make a lot of noise here-for example, loudly arguing about what to do next, setting up a camp, cutting down brush, and so on-the goblins in area 2 notice and attack them through the thicket, which provides the goblins with three-quarters cover (see the rulebook for rules on cover).</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"125\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">2.

The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood (see the \"Flood!\" section of area 5).

If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. \"Truce, or this human dies!\" he shouts.</p><p>Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in area 8, promising to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear's head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn't trust the goblin, and he's right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain.</p><p>If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues with the fight. Sildar takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies (see \"Damage, Healing, and Dying\" in the rulebook).</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"136\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Sildar</span></span> <p>Sildar Hallwinter is a kindhearted human male of nearly fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous griffon cavalry of the great city of Waterdeep. He is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelands.</p><p>Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accompany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords' Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to Iarno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.</p><p>Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the \"Background\" section to the players at this time.)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Spider is.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn't occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle's location. See the \"What the Goblins Know\" sidebar on page 8.)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.</li></ul><p>Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it's the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they'll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"137\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Developments</span></span> <p>If he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn't have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character.</p><p>If Sildar joins the party, see the \"NPC Party Members\" sidebar for tips on how to run him.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"138\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span> <p>Yeemik carries a pouch containing three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp. Sildar's gear, along with Gundren Rockseeker, was taken to Cragmaw Castle.</p><p><b>NPC Party Members</b></p><p>An NPC might join the party, if only for a short time. Here are some tips to help you run an NPC party member:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Let the characters make the important decisions. They are the protagonists of the adventure. If the characters ask an NPC party member for advice or direction, remember that NPCs make mistakes too.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">An NPC won't deliberately put himself or herself in harm's way unless there's a good reason to do so.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">An NPC won't treat all party members the same way, which can create some fun friction. As an NPC gets to know the characters, think about which characters the NPC likes most and which characters the NPC likes least, and let those likes and dislikes affect how the NPC interacts with the various party members.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">In a combat encounter, keep the NPC's actions simple and straightforward. Also, look for things that the NPC can do besides fighting. For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or help barricade a door.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If an NPC contributes greatly to the party's success in a battle, the NPC should receive an equal share of the XP earned for the encounter. (The characters receive less XP as a consequence.)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">NPCs have their own lives and goals. Consequently, an NPC should remain with the party only as long as makes sense for those goals.</li></ul></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"139\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">7.

A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below.

The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest. He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the third person (\"Who dares defy Klarg?\" or \"Klarg will build a throne from your bones, puny ones!\"). The goblins under his command resent his bullying.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"142\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fire Pit</span></span> <p>The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 fire damage to any creature that enters the fire pit, or 1d6 fire damage to any creature that falls prone there.

If the characters rescued Sildar Hallwinter the wounded warrior would appreciate an escort to Phandalin (and will pay 50 gp for the service). Details contained within the characters' backgrounds might prompt them to seek out specific NPCs in the town.</p><p>It's also possible that players might decide to do something different, such as striking out in search of Cragmaw Castle (in part 3 of the adventure).

Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"869\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">What is a Spell?</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p201</span></span> <p>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.</p><p>Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see the appendix), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.</p><p>Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"870\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spell Level</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p201</span></span> <p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the incredible time stop at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.</p><p>Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"871\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Known and Prepared Spells</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p201</span></span> <p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.</p><p>In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's level.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"872\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spell Slots</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p201</span></span> <p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.</p><p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively \"filling\" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).</p><p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"873\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p201</span></span> <p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p><p>Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"874\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p201</span></span> <p>A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"875\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rituals</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p201</span></span> <p>Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.</p><p>It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.</p><p>To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"876\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Casting a Spell</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p202</span></span> <p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.</p><p>Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"877\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Casting in Armor</span></span><p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"878\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Casting Time</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p202</span></span> <p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"879\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bonus Action</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p202</span></span> <p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"880\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reactions</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p202</span></span> <p>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"881\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Longer Casting Times</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p202</span></span> <p>Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see \"Concentration\" below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"882\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Range</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p202</span></span> <p>The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p><p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p><p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you (see \"Areas of Effect\" later in the this chapter).</p><p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"883\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Components</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p203</span></span> <p>A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"884\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Verbal (V)</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p203</span></span> <p>Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"885\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Somatic (S)</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p203</span></span> <p>Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"886\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Material (M)</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p203</span></span> <p>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.</p><p>If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.</p><p>A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"887\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Duration</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p203</span></span> <p>A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists.

All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.</p><p>Mortals can't directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface.</p><p>By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can't light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself.</p><p>All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called <b>arcane magic</b>. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are called <b>divine magic</b>. These spellcasters' access to the Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin's oath.</p><p>Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.</p><p>When characters use divination spells such as <i>detect magic</i> or <i>identify</i>, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as <i>dispel magic</i> smooths the Weave. Spells such as <i>antimagic field</i> rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways—or not at all.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div></div>"}

Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But a few players—with the DM's permission—want to go a step further.</p><p>Chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"651\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Multiclassing</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p163</span></span> <p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.</p><p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.</p><p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely. never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"652\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Prerequisites</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p163</span></span> <p>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table.

class=\"entry-title-inner\">Class Features</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p164</span></span> <p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"658\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Channel Divinity</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p164</span></span> <p>If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"659\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Extra Attack</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p164</span></span> <p>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"660\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unarmored Defense</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p164</span></span> <p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"661\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p164</span></span> <p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"662\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spells Known and Prepared.</span></span> <p>You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can he used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.</p><p>If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"663\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spell Slots.</span></span> <p>You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#burning%20hands_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'burning%20hands_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >burning hands</a>, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.</p><p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3. you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"664\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Pact Magic.</span></span> <p>If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you

It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature and magic item that appears in the adventure. It also introduces the world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the game's most enduring settings, and it teaches you how to run a D&D game.</p><p>The smaller book that accompanies this one (hereafter called \"the rulebook\") contains the rules you need to adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"100\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Running the Adventure</span></span> <p>Lost Mine of Phandelver is an adventure for four to five characters of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, the characters will advance to 5th level. The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North—a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by wilderness and adventure. You don't need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure; everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book.</p><p>If this is your first time running a D&D adventure, read \"The Dungeon Master\" section; it will help you better understand your role and responsibilities.</p><p>The \"Background\" section tells you everything you need to know to set up the adventure. The \"Overview\" section describes how the adventure is expected to run and gives you a broad sense of what the player characters should be doing at any given time.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"101\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Dungeon Master</span></span> <p>The Dungeon Master (DM) has a special role in the Dungeons & Dragons game.</p><p>The DM is a <b>referee</b>. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.</p><p>The DM is a <b>narrator</b>. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters the players must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters' actions.</p><p>The DM <b>plays monsters</b>. The DM plays the monsters and villains the adventurers battle against, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the part of all the other characters the players meet in the course of their adventures, like the prisoner in the goblin lair or the innkeeper in town.</p><p>Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn't have to be the case.</p><p>Although the DM controls the monsters and villains in the adventure, the relationship between the players and the DM isn't adversarial. The DM's job is to challenge the characters with interesting encounters and tests, keep the game moving, and apply the rules fairly.</p><p>The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you have a good time. The rules aren't in charge. You're the DM-you're in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that everybody has fun.</p><p>Many players of Dungeons & Dragons find that being the DM is the best part of the game. With the information in this adventure, you'll be prepared to take on that role for your group.</p><p><b>Rules to Game By</b></p><p>As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.</p><p><b>When in doubt, make it up!</b> It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.</p><p><b>It's not a competition.</b> The DM isn't competing against the player characters. You're there to run the monsters, referee the</p><p>rules, and keep the story moving.</p><p><b>It's a shared story.</b> It's the group's story, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the actions of their</p><p>characters. Dungeons & Dragons is about imagination and coming together to tell a story as a group. Let the players participate in the storytelling.</p><p><b>Be consistent.</b> If you decide that a rule works a certain way in one session, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play.</p><p><b>Make sure everyone is involved.</b> Ensure every character has a chance to shine. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.</p><p><b>Be fair.</b> Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in a fair and impartial manner.</p><p><b>Pay attention.</b> Make sure you look around the table occasionally to see if the game is going well. If everyone seems to be having fun, relax and keep going. If the fun is waning, it might be time for a break, or you can try to liven things up.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"102\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Improvising Ability Checks</span></span> <p>The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. It's up to you to decide whether their attempts are successful. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an ability check; just tell the player what happens. Likewise, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.</p><p>Otherwise, answer these three simple questions:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">What kind of ability check?</li><li class=\"rd__li \">How hard is it?</li><li class=\"rd__li \">What's the result?</li></ul><p>Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use. Then determine how hard the task is so that you can set the DC for the check. The higher the DC, the more difficult the task. The easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use these three DCs:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Easy (DC 10)</b>. An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Moderate (DC 15)</b>. A moderate task requires a slightly higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with a combination of natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Hard (DC 20)</b>. Hard tasks include any effort that is beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability.</li></ul><p>Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck-or a lot of specialized training-to pull off a hard task.</p><p>The outcome of a successful check is usually easy to determine: the character succeeds at whatever he or she set out to accomplish, within reason. It's usually equally easy to figure out what happens when a character fails a check: the character simply doesn't succeed.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"103\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Glossary</span></span> <p>The adventure uses terms that might be unfamiliar to you. A few of these terms are described here. For descriptions of rules-specific terms, see the rulebook.</p><p><b>Characters.</b> This term refers to the adventurers run by the players. They are the protagonists in any D&D adventure. A group of characters or adventurers is called a party.</p><p><b>Nonplayer Characters (NPCs).</b> This term refers to characters run by the DM. How an NPC behaves is dictated by the adventure and by the DM.</p><p><b>Boxed Text.</b> At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that's meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe rooms or present bits of scripted dialogue.</p><p><b>Stat Block.</b> Any monster or NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so that the DM can run it effectively. These statistics are presented in a format called a statistics block, or stat block. You'll find the stat blocks needed for this adventure in appendix B.</p><p><b>Tenday.</b> In the Forgotten Realms, a week is ten days long and called a tenday. Each month consists of three tendays—thirty days total.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"104\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Magic Items and Monsters</span></span> <p>Whenever the text refers to a magic item, its name is presented in italic type. For a description of the item and its magical properties, see appendix A.</p><p>Similarly, whenever the adventure text presents a creature's name in bold type, that's a visual cue directing you to the creature's game statistics in appendix B.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"105\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Abbreviations</span></span> <p>The following abbreviations are used in this adventure:</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><thead><tr><th class=\"\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Abbreviation</th><th class=\"\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Abbreviation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"\"  >DC = Difficulty Class</td><td class=\"\"  >XP = experience points</td></tr><tr><td class=\"\"  >gp = gold piece(s)</td><td class=\"\"  >pp = platinum piece(s)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"\"  >sp = silver piece(s)</td><td class=\"\"  >ep = electrum piece(s)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"\"  >cp = copper piece(s)</td><td class=\"\"  >-</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"106\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Background</span></span> <p>More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.</p><p>A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.</p><p>For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers—a trio of dwarves-have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.</p><p>Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Black Spider controls a network of bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. Now the Black Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he is taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"107\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Overview</span></span> <p>Lost Mine of Phandelver is divided into four parts. In part 1, \"Goblin Arrows,\" the adventurers are on the road to the town of Phandalin when they stumble into a goblin ambush. They discover that the goblins (who belong to the Cragmaw tribe) have captured their dwarf friend Gundren Rockseeker and his escort, a human warrior named Sildar Hallwinter. The characters must deal with the ambushers and then follow their trail back to the goblins' hideout. They rescue Sildar and learn from him that Gundren and his brothers discovered a famous lost mine. Sildar knows only that Gundren and his map have been taken to somewhere called \"Cragmaw Castle.\"</p><p>In part 2, \"Phandalin,\" the characters arrive in Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang of miscreants led by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff. A number of interesting NPCs can also be found in Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in part 3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so the characters return the favor and storm the Redbrand lair. In a hidden stronghold beneath an old manor, they find that Iarno \"Glasstaff\" Albrek, the leader of the Redbrands, is taking his orders from someone called the Black Spider-and that the Black Spider wants the adventurers out of the picture.</p><p>Part 3, \"The Spider's Web,\" provides the characters with several short adventures in the region around Phandalin as they search for more information about the Black Spider and the dwarves' lost mine. The clues the characters picked up in Phandalin can lead them to spy on a mysterious wizard at the ruins of Old Owl Well, seek the advice of a dangerous banshee, oust a band of orcs lurking at Wyvern Tor, and investigate the ruins of the town of Thundertree.</p><p>Several of these leads point to Cragmaw Castle, which is the stronghold of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw goblins. Here the characters discover that the Black Spider is a drow adventurer named Nezznar, and that the Cragmaw goblins work for him (drow are elves who hail from a realm deep underground). More importantly, they recover Gundren Rockseeker's map to the lost mine, or learn the mine's location from one of the other leads they unearth during part 3.</p><p>Following the map or the directions to the lost mine brings the characters to part 4, \"Wave Echo Cave.\" That lost underground complex is now overrun by undead and strange monsters. Nezznar the Black Spider is there with his loyal followers, exploring the mines and searching for the legendary Forge of Spells. The adventurers have the opportunity to avenge Gundren Rockseeker, to ensure the prosperity and security of Phandalin by clearing the rich mine of its monsters, and to put an end to the troublemaking of the Black Spider-if they can survive the dangers of the Lost Mine of Phandelver.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"108\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventure Hook</span></span> <p>You can let players invent their own reasons for visiting Phandalin, or you can use the following adventure hook. The backgrounds and secondary goals on the character sheets also provide characters with motivations for visiting Phandalin.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"109\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Meet Me in Phandalin</span></span> <p>The characters are in the city of Neverwinter when their dwarf patron and friend, Gundren Rockseeker, hires them to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundren has gone ahead with a warrior, Sildar Hallwinter, to attend to business in the town while the characters follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp each by the owner of Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.</p></div><p><b>Roleplaying and Inspiration</b></p><p>One of the things that you can do as the DM is reward players for roleplaying their characters well.</p><p>Each of the characters included in this set has two personality traits (one positive and one negative), an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. These elements can make the character easier and more fun to roleplay. Personality traits provide a glimpse into the character's likes, dislikes, accomplishments, fears, attitude, or mannerisms. An ideal is something that the character believes in or strives for above all else. A character's bond represents a connection to a person, place, or event in the world-someone the character cares about, a place the holds a special connection, or a treasured possession. A flaw is a characteristic that someone else can exploit to bring the character to ruin or cause the character to act against his or her best interests.</p><p>When a player roleplays a negative personality trait or gives in to the drawbacks presented by a bond or flaw, you can give that player one inspiration as a reward. A player with inspiration can use it in a situation where his or her character's personality traits, ideal, or bond relate to what's happening. Spending inspiration gives the character advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. A character can have only one inspiration at a time.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"110\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Forgotten Realms</span></span> <p>Just like a fantasy novel or movie, an adventure is set in a larger world. In fact, the world can be anything that the DM and players can imagine. It could be a swords-and-sorcery setting at the dawn of civilization, where barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves and dwarves wield magic amid the wreckage of a technological civilization. Most D&D settings are somewhere between those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy with knights and castles, as well as elven cities, dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.</p><p>The world of the Forgotten Realms is one such setting, and that's where the story in this adventure takes place. In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Dragons, giants, demons, and unimaginable abominations lurk in dungeons, caverns, ruined cities, and the vast wild places of the world.</p><p>On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors, and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world. Thousands of restless would-be heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every year in search of wealth and renown.</p><p>Known roads may be well traveled, but they aren't necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when you travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</p><p>The regional map shows just a tiny part of this vast world, in a region called the Sword Coast. This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore ruins of long-lost cultures. Amid a wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, lawlessness, and monsters, the coast holds the greatest bastions of civilization, including the coastal city of Neverwinter.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/The Sword Coast.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The Sword Coast\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/The Sword Coast.jpg\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The Sword Coast</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/The Sword Coast (Player).jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The Sword Coast (Player)\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/The Sword Coast (Player).jpg\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The Sword Coast (Player)</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p></div></div></div></div>"}

The Triboar Trail runs right through the abandoned town, providing an easy landmark for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. From the ruins of Conyberry, an old trail leads northwest into Neverwinter Wood. Agatha's lair is a few miles outside town.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters exercise caution and remember what they've come for, they will be able to speak with the banshee. When the characters enter the shelter, read the following:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>A home of sorts is sheltered within the dome of woven branches. It is sparsely furnished with chests, shelves, a table, and a reclined couch, all of it old and of elven craft.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Agatha senses the characters' intrusion and manifests shortly after they enter her home.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A cold, pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking on the form of a female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now. \"Foolish mortals,\" she snarls. \"What do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters are rude, disrespectful, or threatening, Agatha scowls and disappears.

The player whose character takes the lead in speaking with the banshee makes the check. If that player roleplays the encounter well, allow him or her to make the check with advantage. If any character has Sister Garaele's silver comb and presents it to Agatha as a gift, the check is automatically successful.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>The ghostly figure smiles with cold amusement. \"Very well,\" she says. \"I know that you seek many things. Ask me one question, and I will give you an answer.\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters ask about Bowgentle's spellbook, Agatha tells them that she traded the book to a necromancer named Tsernoth from the city of Iriaebor more than a hundred years ago. She does not know what became of the book afterward. Her answer is truthful, and it is all the information Sister Garaele needs for the Harpers to resume their search.</p><p>The characters might instead choose to ask Agatha about something else-for example, the location of Cragmaw Castle, the location of Wave Echo Cave, the identity of the Black Spider, or Hamun Kost's question about Old Owl Well (see that section). Agatha is well informed and a capable diviner, so she can answer almost any single question pertaining to the adventure that the characters think to ask. However, the banshee answers only one question, so the characters should choose it carefully.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"261\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Awarding Experience Points</span></span> <p>The characters gain experience for successfully persuading Agatha to answer a question.

In the tower's courtyard stands an old well that still delivers clean, fresh water. Old Owl Well lies in the wild and rugged hills south of the Triboar Trail. The site is relatively easy to find, and any NPC in Phandalin can provide directions to the ruins.</p><p>Recently, prospectors in the area have noted that someone has set up a campsite at Old Owl Well, and that undead guardians have been posted to keep intruders out.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills. The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tent has been set up in the middle of the courtyard, but no one is in sight.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The ruins are currently occupied by a mage who is busy exploring the site in the hope of gleaning arcane lore left behind by its builders. The characters can enter the site from any direction, either following old footpaths or scrambling up the slope and finding a gap in the surrounding walls of rubble.</p><p>Twelve @Actor[lE2MBUNKjCfczfou]{zombies} lurk inside the crumbled shell of the old watchtower and can't be seen from outside. However, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher smells a deathly odor wafting from the tower's direction. When characters approach the tower or the tent, the zombies shamble out of the tower.</p><p>If a battle erupts, Hamun Kost, the @Actor[RICyFFRxzXZJZ1PH]{evil mage}, emerges from his tent and asks,</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"264\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Red-Robed Mage</span></span><p>\"What is the meaning of this?\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Kost is a stout, red-robed figure with sallow skin, a shaved scalp, and a black tattoo on his forehead. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes Kost's tattoo as a necromantic symbol. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check verifies the garb as that usual for Thay, a land far to the east where wizards pattern their flesh with tattoos. The tattoo on the head represents a wizard's school of magic. Kost's school is necromancy.</p><p>If any character attempts to talk to Kost, even by calling out a greeting or answering his questions during combat, he temporarily calls off his zombies. The Red Wizard is not particularly aggressive, and he is willing to strike a deal that advances his interests at the same time it helps the characters.</p><p>Kost stays tight-lipped about the reason for his presence in the region. He is, however, willing to provide information the party needs if it does a favor for him. If the characters give Kost some indication of what they want, he shares one or both of these requests:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">He wants the orcs at Wyvern Tor removed, since they have scouted out his camp and seem inclined to cause trouble.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">He wants to ask a question of Agatha the banshee: \"What is the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well?\" Kost won't risk the banshee's anger, but the characters could ask the question for him. (Agatha knows the name: Arthindol.)</li></ul><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"265\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span> <p>Hamun Kost's tent contains a comfortable traveling suite, including a cot, a chair, a writing desk, supplies, and a chest of clothes.

Once, this was a prosperous community on the outskirts of the forest, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Then thirty years ago, the eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.</p><p>Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long-with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see area 4) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Cultists have also arrived recently (see area 13) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see area 7).</p><p>As the party approaches the ruins, read the following:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p>Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush. Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather. Other buildings appear more or less intact. The whole place is eerily silent.</p><p>A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads: \"DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Reidoth placed the sign to discourage bands of treasure seekers from stirring up the monsters in the area.</p><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Ruins of Thundertree.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Ruins of Thundertree\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Ruins of Thundertree.jpg\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Ruins of Thundertree</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Ruins of Thundertree (Player).jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Ruins of Thundertree (Player)\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Ruins of Thundertree (Player).jpg\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Ruins of Thundertree (Player)</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"268\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">General Features</span></span> <p>Many of Thundertree's buildings have crumbled in the years since the town was abandoned, even as nature threatens to swallow what remains.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"269\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Buildings.</span></span> <p>A building in Thundertree is either ruined or intact, as shown on the map.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><p>Ruined buildings are empty shells with stone walls 5 to 8 feet high.

He knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and he suspects that someone is hiding out on the eastern side of town-he's seen \"folk in black masks and cloaks\" (the cultists) skulking around. However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower (area 7) since the last time he was here. He warns the characters of all these threats, and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"281\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Developments</span></span> <p>If the characters ask about Cragmaw Castle, Reidoth gladly provides directions.

These orcs often roam into the more civilized areas of the North, spying out human settlements, waylaying travelers, and looting and plundering as opportunities present themselves.

Compare the grick's Dexterity (Stealth) check to the characters' Wisdom (Perception) checks (or their passive scores) to determine who among them is surprised.

The rich mine of the Phandelver's Pact was lost five hundred years ago during orc invasions that devastated this part of the North.</p>\n<p>In the centuries since, countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until the Rockseeker brothers found the entrance a month ago. Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for Nezznar, the Black Spider, and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren's ambush. Learning of the adventurers' involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Phandalin, the Black Spider has given orders for the characters to be dealt with. Meanwhile, Nezznar has begun his exploration of Wave Echo Cave.</p>\n<p>The drow is searching for the Forge of Spells, where the human mages of old Phandalin enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome gadgets. However, Nezznar's exploration has been hindered by the restless undead and dangerous monsters that lurk in Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed with great caution.</p>\n<p>The adventurers now have the chance to aid Gundren, avenge his kin, and put a stop to the nefarious schemes of the Black Spider. And of course, the hoard of powerful magic rumored to be hidden in the mines is a rich prize.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"364\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Level</span></span>\n<p>This part of the adventure is designed for characters of at least 4th level and assumes that each character has earned at least 2,700 XP. If the adventurers skipped too many of the optional investigations and encounters in part 3, they might not be 4th level, and many of the encounters in this section might be difficult for them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"365\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Experience Point Awards</span></span>\n<p>In this part of the adventure, XP is awarded for overcoming monsters, as in parts 2 and 3. However, XP awards for monsters is not given in the encounter description. Instead, the amount of XP that a monster is worth is noted in us stat block. You calculate the award by totaling the value for each monster the characters overcome. Additional XP awards, and the reasons for them, are described in the text, under the \"Awarding Experience Points\" heading.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"366\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wandering Monsters</span></span>\n<p>Monsters roam through all areas of the mine. Random encounters remind players that monsters aren't necessarily confined to specific areas, and that no part of the dungeon is safe. Encounters with wandering monsters are an effective way to keep the players and characters on their toes, alleviate player boredom, and tax party resources. However, having too many random encounters can become tedious, so use them sparingly.</p>\n<p>If the characters spend a long time in a given area, you can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Conversely, if the players seem restless, you can decide that an encounter occurs. Roll a d12 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets.</p>\n<table class=\" striped-odd\" style=\"width: 402px;\"><caption>Wandering Monsters</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"\" style=\"width: 194px;\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Roll</th>\n<th class=\"\" style=\"width: 205px;\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 192px;\">1-3</td>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 203px;\">Stirges (2d4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 192px;\">4-5</td>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 203px;\">Ghouls (1d4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 192px;\">6</td>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 203px;\">Gricks (1d4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 192px;\">7-8</td>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 203px;\">Bugbears (1d4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 192px;\">9</td>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 203px;\">Skeletons (1d6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 192px;\">10</td>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 203px;\">Zombies (1d6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 192px;\">11-12</td>\n<td class=\"\" style=\"width: 203px;\">Ochre Jelly (1)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image\"><a title=\"Wave Echo Cave\" href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Wave Echo Cave.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Wave Echo Cave.jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Wave Echo Cave</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image\"><a title=\"Wave Echo Cave (Player)\" href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Wave Echo Cave (Player).jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Wave Echo Cave (Player).jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Wave Echo Cave (Player)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"367\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">General Features</span></span>\n<p>The mine is cold, damp, and surprisingly drafty.

The rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough to make the stone underfoot shiver. Waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast.</p>\n<p>Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine is connected to an underground hot spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce a surge that slams into a narrow funnel, making a sound like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion. It will pique their curiosity and lure them toward its source, drawing them deeper into the mine as a consequence.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"376\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">1. Cave Entrance</span></span>\n<p>Whether the characters follow Gundren's map or receive directions to Wave Echo Cave from another source, their initial approach leads them to a narrow tunnel whose entrance is hidden within the Sword Mountain foothills.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>The entrance tunnel leads into a large cavern supported by a natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the western part of the cave, behind the column of rock, are three bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies-sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.</p>\n<p>The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>This was the campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead dwarf is Tharden, Gundren's brother, who was killed by the Black Spider. Gundren's other brother, Nundro, was here as well and is currently the Black Spider's prisoner in area 20.</p>\n<p>The dwarves' supplies are potentially useful, but not particularly valuable.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"377\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Open Pit</span></span>\n<p>Climbing up or down the wall of the pit without a rope requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A character who fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the bottom. The tunnel at the bottom of the pit leads northwest toward area 2 and east toward area 3.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"378\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span>\n<p>Tharden wears a pair of @Item[a9TIIH15sBHWBfae]{boots of striding and springing}.

Mine Tunnels</span></span>\n<p>This maze of passages is an old section of Wave Echo Cave's original mine site.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>This area consists of numerous intersecting passages. The ceilings here are only six feet high, and several of the passages end in partially excavated rock faces.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>The dead-end passages are places where the miners gave up and decided to move on to other spots. Patiently lurking in one is an @Actor[kz6AIJryu3RXch2v]{ochre jelly}. When the party enters this section of the mine, the jelly begins to stalk the group, instinctively waiting for an opportunity to attack a lone target.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"380\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">3. Old Entrance</span></span>\n<p>The tunnel that runs south was the original entrance to Wave Echo Cave, but it was buried by the destruction that wracked the mines centuries ago. A pitched battle was fought here when the orcs stormed the mines. The dead still lie where they fell.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>Many tunnels intersect at this natural, thirty-foot-high cavern. The walls are carved with simple reliefs showing dwarf and gnome miners hard at work. Below them, nearly two dozen skeletons in rusted scraps of armor are scattered across the cavern floor. Some are dwarf skeletons, while others are orc remains. Half a dozen large brass lanterns stand in niches or on ledges around the cavern, but none are lit.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>Clinging to the ceiling like bats are ten @Actor[WHw5yyEYaSqKSVhF]{stirges}. The monsters find scant living prey in the mines, and they are ravenous. If the characters are looking down at the skeletons on the floor, the stirges are likely get the drop on them. Any character who isn't watching the ceiling is surprised unless his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is higher than the stirges' Dexterity (Stealth) check total (roll once for all of them). Characters who aren't surprised hear a flapping noise as the stirges descend to attack.</p>\n<p>The lanterns and the carvings of miners at work were meant as a welcome to newcomers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"381\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">4.

Amid ruined stone bunks and toppled weapon racks are the bones of several dwarves and orcs.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>In the round after any living creature enters this chamber, the bones begin to stir and knit together, forming nine @Actor[nH5j74JAEqxP0QmS]{skeletons}.

A large stone counter bisects the room, set with three dusty balance scales made of iron. Cubbyholes carved into the north wall are stuffed with dusty paper scraps. Several long-dead corpses-gnomes and orcs by their look-are sprawled across the floor.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>The centuries-old paper in the cubbyholes disintegrates if touched, but a character who reads Dwarvish can see faint markings on a few scraps, recording weigh-ins and disbursements.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"383\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span>\n<p>Behind the counter sits a locked iron strongbox, requiring thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check to open.

To the north, a door stands ajar, leading to a good-sized storeroom. Dusty kegs are tucked neatly against the walls, all of them cracked and split open from age.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>It's not comfortable, but the storeroom is a secure resting place. No monsters come this way.

The growth includes puffballs a foot across, weird shelf fungus growing on stalagmites, and large stalks and caps a good five feet tall. Some of the puffballs glow with an eerie green phosphorescence.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>Most of the fungi is harmless, and the green-glowing fungi allow creatures to see the entire cavern without the aid of darkvision or a light source.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"387\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Poison Gas</span></span>\n<p>Whenever a creature attempts to cross the cavern, the carpets of fungi that cover most of the floor release poisonous gas into the air. Each creature in the cavern must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage and be poisoned for 10 minutes (see the rulebook for more information on the poisoned condition). The gas disperses after 1 minute, but until then, any living creature that ends its turn in the cavern must repeat the saving throw.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"388\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">9. Great Cavern</span></span>\n<p>This cave once served as the banquet room, meeting area, and mead hall for the miners.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>Steep escarpments divide this large cavern into three sections-high ledges at either end, and a lower section in the middle. Carved stone stairs climb up to the ledges. Two large tables stand in the middle section, along with a pair of old braziers. A smaller table stands on the eastern ledge. The skeletal remains of dozens of dead warriors-dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and ogres-attest to the fierceness of the fighting that took place here long ago.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>Seven @Actor[MdzW3zOFZrgVygnr]{ghouls} lurk in the shadows on the western ledge.</p>\n<p>They notice any light or noise elsewhere in the cave and quickly bound down to attack. The undead are hungry and fight until destroyed.</p>\n<p>The escarpments are 10 feet high and require a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.

The water is dark, revealing little of what might lie within. The shore of the pool consists of a thin layer of broken shells from strange, pale mussels, and a fishy odor hangs in the air.</p>\n<p>A passage leads south from this area, and a set of steps climbs up to the east. A sluggish stream flows out of the cave to the northeast.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>The pool is 20 feet deep in the middle. The stream to the northeast is 3 feet deep, and the ceiling of the passage is 2 to 3 feet above the water. Characters can easily wade through the stream to area 18.</p>\n<p>A character who explores the pool finds an old skeleton lying on the bottom, 10 feet from the shore and under 10 feet of water. These are the remains of a human wizard from old Phandalin who died defending the mines against the orc attackers. Several orc arrows are still lodged in the skeleton's ribcage.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"390\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span>\n<p>The skeleton wears two platinum rings (75 gp each) and clutches a @Item[eNSm6nPvx3DKSKgG]{wand of magic missiles} in its bony fingers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"391\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">11. North Barracks</span></span>\n<p>The eastern door is barricaded from inside the room and requires a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open.

The drow is still formulating a plan to get past the undead guardians in this area.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>A blast furnace and a mechanical bellows powered by a waterwheel dominate this large chamber. The furnace is cold and dark, but heaps of coal are piled nearby, along with carts full of unrefined ore. The waterwheel sits in a ten-foot-wide channel cut into the floor of the room, but the channel is dry. Passages exit to the west, south, and east. The empty channel exits to the north and east.</p>\n<p>More than a dozen withered corpses are scattered around the room. These slain dwarves and orcs are still wearing the remnants of their armor. Floating above them is a skull engulfed in green flame.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>Eight of the fallen dwarf warriors are @Actor[lE2MBUNKjCfczfou]{zombies}. They rise and pursue any living creatures that enter the room, but they do not pursue creatures outside this area for more than 1 round. In addition, a far more intelligent undead guards this area: a @Actor[mGFFsbv6u5ym45vc]{flameskull}. This creature was a servant of the human wizards allied with the Phandelver dwarves and gnomes, and it continues to act on ancient instructions to prevent intruders from passing through.</p>\n<p>This impressive chamber was the heart of the Wave Echo Cave mining operation. Here, the dwarves melted down their ore to refine ingots of silver, gold, and platinum. The dry channel is where the dwarves diverted the stream from area 18 to power the waterwheel here. That in turn operated the bellows that fed the furnace.</p>\n<p>The channel's bottom is 5 feet below floor level, and no ability check is required to scramble in or out. Characters in the channel can follow it out of this room to the north or to the east, though the ceiling is only 5 feet high after the channel exits this room.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"394\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">13. Starry Cavern</span></span>\n<p>The structural damage and the skeletal remains in this area are evidence of the destructive spell battle fought here centuries ago when the arcs and their mercenary wizards stormed the mines.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>Glittering minerals in the ceiling of this large cavern catch the light and send it back to create the impression of a starry night sky. Dozens of skeletons-many crushed under fallen debris-are scattered across the floor.</p>\n<p>The cave is large enough that it contains two freestanding structures. Each of these stone buildings is proportioned for human use, as opposed to the dwarf-sized doorways and furnishings you've seen elsewhere in the mines. Both structures have battered and blackened masonry walls, their double doors cracked and scorched. The cavern is divided by an escarpment, into which a flight of stairs has been cut.</p>\n<p>Passages lead out of this area to the north, south, and west.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>The damaged buildings are described in areas 14 and 15. Minerals in the ceiling are pretty, but they are neither magical nor valuable.</p>\n<p>Any character proficient in Arcana can sense a subtle aura of magic in this cavern. (A @Item[j2giPkXb33hGJJZE]{detect magic} spell reveals the same.) The aura becomes stronger as one approaches the northern building (area 15).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"395\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">14. Wizards' Quarters</span></span>\n<p>The doors leading into this area are cracked, their iron hinges partially melted. Wrenching or smashing open the doors requires a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>Dust, ash, walls blackened by fire, and heaps of debris beneath the sagging ceiling show that this room was damaged by a destructive blast. The furnishings-tables, chairs, bookshelves, beds-are charred or splintered, but otherwise well preserved. A scorched iron chest stands near the foot of one of the beds.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>This room contains the restless spirit of the last wizard to die here: @Actor[6jDtuvNMMqcKTxmR]{Mormesk the wraith}. He is not immediately visible but rises up out of the floor when a living creature enters the room.</p>\n<p>Mormesk was a powerful mage until he met his end in the spell battle at the climax of the orc attack. Centuries of anger have poisoned his soul, transforming him into a hate-filled apparition.</p>\n<p>Mormesk leads the undead that haunt Wave Echo Cave. The wraith spends his time here because the treasure he had amassed in life is in the scorched chest (see the \"Treasure\" section). No longer corporeal, he cannot touch or possess the wealth he enjoyed in life.</p>\n<p>This building served as a guesthouse for visiting wizards working in the Forge of Spells (area 15), most of whom were humans from nearby cities. The furnishings are all human proportioned.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"396\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Mormesk</span></span>\n<p>Mormesk speaks in grave whispers. When the wraith first rises up from the floor, it says, \"Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!\" If the characters make no attempt to reason with the wraith, it attacks.</p>\n<p>If the characters try to reason with the wraith, it listens to what they have to say, provided they have not harmed it in any way or seized any of its property. The wraith is irrevocably evil, so the only way the characters can stay its spectral hand is to offer it something a former wizard would consider valuable in exchange for their lives. Mormesk values magic items (particularly scrolls), spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. Whatever the gift, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the wraith of its value.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what the characters offer it, the wraith won't relinquish the wooden pipe in the scorched chest. It will, however, part with the coins and gems if the characters agree to kill the spectator in the Forge of Spells. (The wraith doesn't explain what a spectator is. It merely points toward area 15.) Once it receives its gift, the wraith allows characters to peruse its books and keep the secret map in one of them (see the \"Treasure\" section).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"397\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span>\n<p>The scorched chest is unlocked and contains 1,100 cp, 160 sp, 50 ep, three diamonds (100 gp each), and a wooden pipe adorned with platinum filigree (150 gp).</p>\n<p>A handful of magically preserved tomes remain on the shelves. Most are just histories, but one has a map sewn into its cover. The map's presence can be discerned with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The map shows the location of a dungeon of your own creation. When the characters finish their explorations here, this old map can lead them to their next adventure.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"398\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">15. Forge of Spells</span></span>\n<p>Here is where the wizards allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact channeled the magic of these caverns to enchant dwarven arms and gnome gadgets. The northernmost door is scorched and cracked, its iron hinges partially melted; forcing it open requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. The western double doors are just as damaged but stand slightly ajar.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>This large workshop was badly damaged by the ancient spell battle that laid waste to the mine. Worktables taking up two corners of the room are scorched, and the plaster has been burned off the masonry walls. In the middle of the room, a stone pedestal holds a small brazier in which an eerie green flame dances and crackles. The brazier and its pedestal appear to have been untouched by the forces that destroyed this area.</p>\n<p>Behind the brazier of green flame floats a spherical creature measuring roughly four feet in diameter. Four eyestalks protrude from its central mass, two on each side. In the center of the body is a large eye that stares at you. \"Hello,\" says a thick, burbling voice inside your head.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>The monster that guards this room is a @Actor[a2YhtyFy0lUSVaPT]{spectator}. One of the human wizards who worked in the Forge of Spells summoned the creature to guard the magic items created and stored here. When the mine was sacked, the orcs disturbed the delicate magic in the area, unhinging the spectator's grip on reality. It has become deranged and believes that the mine is still in use, ignoring all evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>The wraith (area 14) wants to drive off or kill the spectator, but so far, the creature has easily handled the assaults of Mormesk's zombies and ghouls while seeing nothing strange about undead roaming the mine. If the party attempts to remove anything from this area, the spectator attacks. If the spectator is blinded somehow, it disappears back to its home plane, convinced that it can no longer perform the task for which it was summoned.</p>\n<p>With a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check, a character can trick the spectator into thinking one or more party members are wizards or miners who work for the owners of Wave Echo Cave, sent to terminate the spectator's employment. If the deception succeeds, the spectator believes it is released from its obligations, and it disappears and returns to its home plane.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"399\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Brazier of Green Flame</span></span>\n<p>A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the brazier as the source of the magic that suffuses the surrounding caverns. This magic has waned over the years, to the extent that it can no longer be harnessed to permanently enchant magic items. However, any nonmagical weapon or armor bathed in the green flame for at least 1 minute becomes a @Item[PLlgUjgfzHo5nj0b]{+1 weapon} or @Item[dkO0EpHXi7afhCuF]{+1 armor}, respectively, for 1d12 hours. The brazier cannot be removed from the Forge of Spells.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"400\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Northern Room</span></span>\n<p>This small room is a separate workspace, where items being prepared for enchantment were polished, lacquered, and otherwise finished.

Booming Cavern</span></span>\n<p>The sound of pounding surf that gives Wave Echo Cave its name can be traced to this water-filled cavern.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>A narrow ledge overlooks a large cavern that houses a surging, seething body of water. The rhythmic booming heard throughout the mines is louder here. At regular intervals, a fresh surge of water funnels into this chamber and slams against the wall just below the ledge. The echo suggests that this cave might be one arm of a much larger cavern to the northeast.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>The ledge that hugs the south wall is 15 feet above water level. However, when water surges into the cave every 2 minutes, it raises the water level by 10 feet. After a minute, the water level returns to its normal depth of 20 feet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"403\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">17. Old Streambed</span></span>\n<p>The stream flowing from area 10 to area 18 used to continue through this low passage, eventually emptying out into area 16.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>This passageway is barely four feet high and is obstructed by rounded boulders and pebbles. It might have been a streambed, though no water flows here now.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>The dwarves diverted the stream into the channel leading to area 12 to drive the waterwheel in the smelter. Then the earthquakes that rocked Wave Echo Cave during the final spell battle of the orc invasion collapsed the floor in area 18, diverting the stream once again. The old streambed remains as a usable passage that circumvents the undead in area 12, although Nezznar has not yet discovered this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"404\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">18. Collapsed Cavern</span></span>\n<p>Nezznar's servants occupy this cavern, guarding against undead incursions and carefully sifting through the rubble. The Black Spider's divinations suggest that some valuable treasure is hidden at the bottom of the rift that was created when this area was destroyed.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>A wide rift fills the eastern half of this cavern. A stream pours out of the west wall, then tumbles down into the rift and flows out again to the north. Several ropes are secured to iron stakes along on the western edge of the rift, leading down to the chasm floor.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>Three @Actor[HkNCqtqwLTuVBjQZ]{bugbears} are stationed here. Two of them are clearing rock on the rift floor while one more stands guard in the western half of the cavern. A @Actor[ybZE5qxFSdjYhS2P]{doppelganger} named Vhalak supervises the operation in the guise of a male drow. If a fight breaks out in the main cavern, the two bugbears in the rift climb up the ropes to join the fray.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"405\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rift</span></span>\n<p>The rift is 20 feet deep. Climbing up or down without using a rope requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature that fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the bottom.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"406\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Developments</span></span>\n<p>If two or more bugbears are killed, the doppelganger tries to retreat to area 19 to warn Nezznar.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"407\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span>\n<p>Nezznar's divinations are accurate.

Large emeralds gleam in the statue's eyes.</p>\n<p>The dust and debris covering the floor has been swept to one side, and a campsite of sorts now spreads in front of the statue. Half a dozen bedrolls and packs are neatly arranged around a rough-built fire pit. A wooden table stands on the west side of the room between two pillars.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>If the room's occupants are not aware of the characters as they enter, add the following:</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\">\n<p>Two bugbears stand by the table, flanking a dark elf dressed in black leather armor and robes.

Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the spiders. When intruders appear, the spiders try to entangle them in webs before closing to melee range. Nezznar joins the fray on the round after the spiders attack.</p>\n<p>If the @Actor[ybZE5qxFSdjYhS2P]{doppelganger} from area 18 retreated to this area, it assumes the guise of Nundro Rockseeker so that Nezznar can use the \"dwarf\" as leverage to force the party's surrender (although the drow won't actually harm the doppelganger).

Any character who has proficiency in Religion recognizes the deity. The statue is beautifully carved, and its emerald eyes appear extremely valuable. However, the jewels are clever fakes made of worthless glass, as close inspection and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals. Nevertheless, a powerful spell protects them, and a @Item[j2giPkXb33hGJJZE]{detect magic} spell reveals a strong aura of abjuration magic surrounding the statue.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A character can climb the statue easily and pry a jewel loose with a successful DC 10 Strength check. However, if either eye is removed, the pillars that line the walls crack, triggering a ceiling collapse. Each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 bludgeoning damage from falling rubble and falling prone on a failure, or taking only half the damage on a success.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"410\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Table</span></span>\n<p>The table is strewn with notes and maps showing Nezznar's efforts at exploring the mine so far.

He will say or do anything to put the characters off their guard, including promising to surrender or proposing cooperation against the monsters impeding his progress toward reaching the Forge of Spells.

However, unless the characters post guards outside Nezznar's cell, Halia Thornton (see page 17) breaks him out of jail, smuggles him out of Phandalin, and delivers him into the waiting arms of the Zhentarim. The Zhents want to learn everything the Black Spider knows about Wave Echo Cave.

The figure lying on the floor is Nundro, a dwarf @Actor[5XbdgsjQ9e7ngL73]{commoner} and the youngest of the three Rockseeker brothers. Nezznar spared him because he thought the dwarf might know more about the mine than he admitted.

Their deeds will be long remembered in this corner of the Sword Coast. In years to come, the restored mines of the Phandelver's Pact will bring great riches to Phandalin and help establish peace and prosperity in the area.</p>\n<p>Gundren and Nundro Rockseeker take over administration of the new mine. For the adventurers' service to their family, they gladly award the party a 10 percent share of the mine's profits. If the characters want to remain in Phandalin and perhaps restore Tresendar Manor or establish homes of their own, the people of the area are glad to have them stay. Even if they choose to move on in search of new adventures, they'll always have a warm welcome in Phandalin.</p>\n<p>By the end of the adventure, the characters should be 5th level. If your players wish to continue playing their characters, you can use the contents of this set to create your own adventures; the mysterious map found in area 14 of Wave Echo Cave provides one possible adventure hook, but feel free to explore other ideas using the monsters, magic items, and locations in this adventure. If you want to create adventures for characters higher than 5th level, you'll need the basic rules online or the advanced rulebooks: the <em>Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide</em> and <em>Monster Manual</em>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":""}

They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against.</p><p>Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god's unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.</p><p>Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard's spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve.</p><p>Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.</p><p>Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and dabble in the cleric class while continuing to advance as a rogue. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with magical training and advance as fighters and wizards simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, can be found in the Chapter 6.</p><p>Twelve classes—listed in the Classes table—are found in almost every D&D world and define

It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p><b>Dungeon Master (DM):</b> After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.</p><p><b>Phillip (playing Gareth):</b> I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they're not just statues.</p><p><b>Amy (playing Riva):</b> The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\" ><p><b>Dungeon Master (DM):</b> OK, one at a time. Phillip, you're looking at the gargoyles?</p><p><b>Phillip:</b> Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?</p><p><b>DM:</b> Make an Intelligence check.</p><p><b>Phillip:</b> Does my Investigation skill apply?</p><p><b>DM:</b> Sure!</p><p><b>Phillip (rolling a d20):</b> Ugh. Seven.</p><p><b>DM:</b> They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends).</p><p>Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.</p><p>One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game's lead storyteller and referee.</p><p>The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.</p><p>The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's level.</p><p>There's no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"437\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Worlds of Adventure</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p5</span></span> <p>The many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.</p><p>The worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the <b>multiverse</b>, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and 10 other planes or existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds.</p><p>Many of them have been published as official settings for the D&D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.</p><p>All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are Jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron's war-forged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they're all D&D worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.</p><p>Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play or the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a published world.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"438\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using this Book</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p6</span></span> <p>The Player's Handbook is divided into three parts.</p><p><b>Part 1</b> is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you'll play in the game. It includes information on the various races. classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3. If you come across a game concept in part 1 that you don't understand, consult the book's index.</p><p><b>Part 2</b> details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game; exploration, interaction, and combat.</p><p><b>Part 3</b> is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the huge variety of spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"439\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">How to Play</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p6</span></span> <p><b>1. The DM describes the environment.</b> The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on).</p><p><b>2. The players describe what they want to do.</b> Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, \"We'll take the east door,\" for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don't need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.</p><p>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p><p><b>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions.</b> Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</p><p>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon.</p><p>In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p><p>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"440\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Game Dice</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p6</span></span> <p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.</p><p>In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter <b>d</b> followed by the number of sides - d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p><p>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9.</p><p>One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p><p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, \"3d8 + 5\" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p><p>The same d notation appears in the expressions \"1d3\" and \"1d2.\" To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it's a 2.)</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"441\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The D20</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p7</span></span> <p>Does an adventurer's sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p><p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six <b>ability scores</b>. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf.</p><p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p><p><b>1. Roll the die and add a modifier.</b> Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character's particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability's modifier.)</p><p><b>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</b> A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p><p><b>3. Compare the total to a target number.</b> If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p><p>The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <b>Difficulty Class</b> (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an <b>Armor Class</b> (AC).</p><p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"442\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Advantage and Disadvantage</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p7</span></span> <p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p><p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"443\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Specific Beats General</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p7</span></span> <p>This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.</p><p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don't have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can't normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"444\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Round Down</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p7</span></span> <p>There's one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"445\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventures</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p7</span></span> <p>The Dungeons & Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.</p><p>The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM's needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it's an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure's action.</p><p>Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they'll try to do next.</p><p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.</p><p>But that's not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"446\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Three Pillars of Adventure</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p8</span></span> <p>Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p><p><b>Exploration</b> includes both the adventurers' movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result.</p><p>On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.</p><p><b>Social-interaction</b> features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.</p><p>The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4.</p><p><b>Combat,</b> the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on-all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there's still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"447\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Wonders of Magic</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p8</span></span> <p>Few D&D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10 and 11.</p><p>In the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it's usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.</p><p>For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.</p><p>Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!</p></div></div></div></div>"}

Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.</p><p>And the people themselves—people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues—represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.</p><p>Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow—a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind. The Player's Handbook has more information about these unusual races.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"471\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Uncommon Races</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p33</span></span> <p>The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this list are uncommon. They don't exist in every world of D&D, and even where they are found, they are less widespread than dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&D multiverse, most people hardly look twice at members of even the most exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot the countryside are different.

When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p><p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p><p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p><p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p><p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character's personality, ideals, or bonds. The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"670\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Proficiency Bonus</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p173</span></span> <p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p><p>Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p><p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks.

The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p><p>For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Typical Difficulty Classes</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-9\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Task Difficulty</th><th class=\"col-3 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-9\"  >Very easy</td><td class=\"col-3 text-center\"  >5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-9\"  >Easy</td><td class=\"col-3 text-center\"  >10</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-9\"  >Medium</td><td class=\"col-3 text-center\"  >15</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-9\"  >Hard</td><td class=\"col-3 text-center\"  >20</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-9\"  >Very hard</td><td class=\"col-3 text-center\"  >25</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-9\"  >Nearly impossible</td><td class=\"col-3 text-center\"  >30</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier.</p><p>As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"672\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Contests</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p174</span></span> <p>Sometimes onc character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen to the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p><p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p><p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"673\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skills</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p174</span></span> <p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in.

In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far.

For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive.

Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.</p><p>Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might undertake a quest to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of the Abyss, or find yourself hoisting a tankard with the friendly giants of Ysgard. You might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"918\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Material Plane</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p300</span></span> <p>The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All the worlds of D&D exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.</p><p>The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the DMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.</p><p>The best-known worlds in the multiverse are the ones that have been published as official campaign settings for the D&D game over the years—Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms, Mystara, Birthright, Dark Sun, and Eberron, among others.</p><p>Each of these worlds boasts its own cast of heroic adventurers and scheming villains, its own ancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its own dungeons and its own dragons.

The Feywild and the Shadowfell are parallel dimensions occupying the same cosmological space, so they are often called echo planes or mirror planes to the Material Plane. The worlds and landscapes of these planes mirror the natural world of the Material Plane but reflect those features into different forms—more marvelous and magical in the Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell. Where a volcano stands in the Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the Feywild, and a jagged rock outcropping resembling a skull marks the spot on the Shadowfell.</p><p>The <b>Feywild,</b> also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of soft lights and wonder, a country of little people with great desires, a place of music and death. It is a realm of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of the setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun never truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by the Seelie Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and syrupy fens—perfect territory for the Unseelie to hunt their prey. Fey creatures, such as those brought to the world by conjure woodland beings and similar spells, dwell in the Feywild.</p><p>The <b>Shadowfell,</b> also called the Plane of Shadow, is a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white where color has been leached from everything. It is a place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"920\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Positive and Negative Planes</span></span><p>Like a dome above the other planes, the <b>Positive Plane</b> is the source of radiant energy and the raw life force that suffuses all living beings, from the puny to the sublime.

Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches—the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental Planes.

Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations—circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"925\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Transitive Planes</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p301</span></span> <p>The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as etherealness and astral projection allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.</p><p>The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.</p><p>The <b>Astral Plane</b> is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"926\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Inner Planes</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p301</span></span> <p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four <b>Elemental Planes</b>—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water—form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning <b>Elemental Chaos.</b></p><p>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form—great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"927\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Outer Planes</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p301</span></span> <p>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction.</p><p>Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.</p><p>When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \"places\" at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p><p>Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.</p><p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day—if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.</p><p>The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Outer Planes</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-8\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Outer Plane</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Alignment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >LG</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Bytopia, the Twin Paradises of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >NG, LG</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Elysium, the Blessed Fields of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >NG</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >The Beastlands, the Wilderness of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >NG, CG</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Arborea, the Olympian Glades of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >CG</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Ysgard, the Heroic Domains of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >CN, CG</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Limbo, the Ever-Changing Chaos of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >CN</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Pandemonium, the Windswept Depths of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >CN, CE</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >The Abyss, the Infinite Layers of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >CE</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Carceri, the Tarterian Depths of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >NE, CE</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Hades, the Gray Waste of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >NE</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Gehenna, the Bleak Eternity of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >NE, LE</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >The Nine Hells (of Baator)</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >LE</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Acheron, the Infinite Battlefield of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >LN, LE</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Mechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >LN</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-8\"  >Arcadia, the Peaceable Kingdoms of</td><td class=\"col-4\"  >LN, LG</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the <b>Upper Planes.</b> Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes.

A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance there.

That argument might be circular, however, for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.</p><p>Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, are the <b>gate-towns</b>: sixteen settlements, each built around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each town shares many of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads.</p><p>At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of the planar wheel, the Spire shoots impossibly high into the sky. Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, the City of Doors. This bustling planar metropolis holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.</p><p>Sigil is a trader's city. Goods, merchandise, and information come to it from across the planes. There is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in particular in the command words or items required for the operation of particular portals. These portal keys are highly sought after, and many travelers within the city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key to allow them to continue on their way.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"930\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Demiplanes</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p302</span></span> <p>Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane.</p><p>Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"931\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Far Realm</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p302</span></span> <p>The Far Realm is beyond the known multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, life and matter are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy ordinary geometry and biology.</p><p>The entities that abide in the Far Realm are too alien for a normal mind to accept without damage. Titanic creatures swim through nothingness, preoccupied with madness. Unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a triumph of mind over the rude boundaries of matter, space, and eventually sanity.</p><p>There are no known portals to the Far Realm, or at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the portal's location—even its home world—is long forgotten. Other portals might still exist, marked by the alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material Plane around them.</p></div></div><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/rules/Planes-2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/rules/Planes-2.png\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div></p></div></div></div>"}

Every adventure holds the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding one or more magic items, and part of the fun of exploring a dungeon is the thrill of unearthing an item found nowhere else.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"420\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using a Magic Item</span></span> <p>A magic item's description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. Casting the @Item[iwrGWo84V7MCeyCx]{identify} spell on the item then reveals its properties. Alternatively, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.</p><p>Certain magic items require a user to <b>attune</b> to them before their magical properties can be used. Attuning to a magic item requires that you spend a short rest concentrating on it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn an item's properties). Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted. Once you are attuned to an item, you can use its magical properties.</p><p>An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at any given time, and you can attune yourself to only one item during a short rest.</p><p>Your attunement to an item ends when the item has been more than 100 feet away from you for 24 hours and when you die. You can also voluntarily end your attunement to an item with another short rest.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"421\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Item Descriptions</span></span> <div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"422\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">+1 Armor</span></span> <p>The most basic form of magic armor is a superb product of physical and magical craft.

For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave society and come to the surface.</p><p>You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's image.

Consider the following two human fighters.</p><p>Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father's trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragon armies laid waste to the town of Solace and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure alongside the friends she'd known from her childhood. Her skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring career.</p><p>Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Cailmport in the Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one of the city's hundreds of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful thieves' guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the city's pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover some stolen gems. He's a professional killer, constantly challenging himself to improve his skills.</p><p>Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"492\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Height and Weight</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p121</span></span> <p>You can decide your character's height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character's ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.</p><p>If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character's height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table.</p><p>The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character's extra height (in inches) beyond the base height.

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).</p><p>Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.</p><p>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.</p><p><b>Lawful good</b> (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.</p><p><b>Neutral good</b> (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.</p><p><b>Chaotic good</b> (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</p><p><b>Lawful neutral</b> (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.</p><p><b>Neutral</b> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.</p><p><b>Chaotic neutral</b> (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</p><p><b>Lawful evil</b> (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</p><p><b>Neutral evil</b> (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths are neutral evil.</p><p><b>Chaotic evil</b> (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"496\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Alignment in the Multiverse</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p122</span></span> <p>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.</p><p>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods.</p><p>Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc god Gruumsh, and are thus inclined towards evil. Even if orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)</p><p>Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends.</p><p>Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.</p><p>A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.</p><p>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are <b>unaligned</b>. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"497\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tika and Artemis: Alignment</span></span><p>Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder. As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must—and when it's in his own best interests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups alongside others who don't share their interests and objectives.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"498\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p123</span></span> <p>Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice.

Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character's favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.</p><p>Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You're not bound to those options, but they're a good starting point.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"500\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Personality Traits</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p123</span></span> <p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. \"I'm smart\" is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. \"I've read every book in Candlekeep\" tells you something specific about your character's interests and disposition.</p><p>Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character's self attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.</p><p>A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"501\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ideals</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p124</span></span> <p>Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.</p><p>Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?</p><p>You can choose any ideals you like, but your character's alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"502\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bonds</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p124</span></span> <p>Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character's connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character's motivations and goals.</p><p>Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?</p><p>Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character's history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"503\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Flaws</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p124</span></span> <p>Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"504\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tika and Artemis: Personal Characteristics</span></span><p>Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is always prepared for the worst and moves with quick, precise confidence.</p><p>Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power. Tika Waylan's bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn's proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased \"I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.\"Artemis Entreri's bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do'Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, some indication that if his life had gone differently, might have led a life more like the heroic drow's. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin—he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as \"I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do'Urden.\"Each of these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and annoyed that they still think of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be tempted to act against her principles if she's convinced that a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity.</p><p>Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal relationship and just wants to be left alone.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"505\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Inspiration</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p125</span></span> <p>Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that's true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"506\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gaining Inspiration</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p125</span></span> <p>Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game. You either have inspiration or you don't—you can't stockpile multiple \"inspirations\" for later use.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"507\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Inspiration</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p125</span></span> <p>If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll. Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game.</p><p>When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"508\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Backgrounds</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p125</span></span> <p>Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.</p><p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?</p><p>The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"509\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Proficiencies</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p125</span></span> <p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7.</p><p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5.</p><p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"510\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link\">p125</span></span> <p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race.

To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw.</p><p>If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"514\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tika and Artemis: Backgrounds</span></span><p>Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest years as street urchins.
